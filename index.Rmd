![Hello!](D:/Website/website/headshot.jpg)

Thank for stopping by. My name is Reed. I am a currently a PhD student at the University of Vermont studying amphibian disease ecology. 

I consider myself a community and disease ecologist as well as herpetologist. The current goal of my research is to understand  how the  assemblage of species present in a system can determine disease prevalence. I will be answering this question using a  variety of methods, ranging from computer modelling to boots-on-the-ground field sampling.

In making this website, my goal is to increase my public presence and make my own research and knowledge. You may find my   current publications, CV, and research goals, but I also intend to provide semi-frequent updates on my research and also  
include posts on my areas of expertise. Feel free to have a look around!
